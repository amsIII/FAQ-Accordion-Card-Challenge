## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I created the background for the page and card. I then created a single FAQ, starting with the FAQ shown in active state in the design previews. I move all of the FAQs into an array as objects

```
{
  id: 1,
	question: "How many team members can I invite?",
	answer: "You can invite up to 2 additional users on the Free plan. There is no limit on team members for the Premium plan.",
}
```

so I could map over them instead of hard coding each question one by one. And then I added the images, positioning them with `position: absolute;` and playing with the top/left/bottom/right values until I got it just right. Took me a little longer than what I was expecting, but its done!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Did you know that params can be passed to ReactJs event heandler onClick? I do now! I going to create another solution for this using VanillaJs. I'll add it to this repository (and FE mentor solutions, if possible) when its done.
